Tatanka is an open source, relatively small, website/application framework for the LAMP stack. 

Its purpose is to provide the basic structure of a website, application, or api plus some basic functionality in order to allow developers to rapidly build in the lamp stack. 

A developer using Tatanka never has to touch or modify any of the Tatanka files. Once setup Tatanka contains all the universal structure &amp; functionality a website, api, or an application requires. A developer can simply extend the Tatanka app class and get started.
